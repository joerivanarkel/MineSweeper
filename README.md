## üöÄ Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Blazor WebAssembly with GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Wait for deployment:**
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
   - The deployment workflow will automatically run
   - Once complete, your app will be available at: `https://vanarkel.github.io/MineSweeper/`

### How it Works:

- The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow automatically builds and deploys the app when you push to the `master` branch
- The app is built using `dotnet publish`
- The base path is automatically updated to match your repository name
- A `.nojekyll` file is added to ensure proper routing
- A `404.html` file is created for SPA fallback routing
